## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-First off, I realized that I needed to do a refresher of my front-end 
 developer tech stack including html, css, and javascript through the use of doing practice projects from Youtube videos.

-I would say that challenge 3, was the hardest for my due to having to remember the functionality of og template literals.

-Each challenge utilize familiar concepts, though it highlighted useful ways of going about displaying JSON data on a webpage is various ways. 

- Overall, the challenges made me appreciate the versatlity of jvascript and the the background information in each challenge especially, helped to jump start me finishing the task. There was times, I would come across the first step and feel at a lost of how to go about completing it. through simply, taking a step back and research what I did know, I discovered the questions I should have been asking myself toward find the solution.
