- I wanted to update the visual design of the website to make it more asthetically pleasing to the eye by including margin styling to the content and add a footer. I also nclude a button in the header to navigate to the "Our Games" section quickly.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- First off, I realized that I needed to do a refresher of my front-end 
 developer tech stack including html, css, and javascript through the use of doing practice projects from Youtube videos.

- I would say that challenge 3, was the hardest section for me due to realizing that I needed to take a deeper dive into how to best utilize template literals and combine familar concepts together to make a dynamic list based on a JSON string literal of data.

- Each challenge utilize familiar concepts, though it highlighted useful ways of going about displaying JSON data on a webpage is various ways. For me destructors was a newer concept but I I remeber using spreads during my intership project.

- During challenge 5, I found myself getting stuck on how to properly add the ternary logic within a template literal but, in retrospect, it turned out to be a simple mistake.

- Overall, the challenges made me appreciate the versatlity of jvascript and the the background information in each challenge especially, helped to jump start me finishing the task. 
    - There was times, I would come across the first step and feel at a lost of how to go about completing it. through simply, taking a step back and research what I did know, I discovered the questions I should have been asking myself toward find the solution.
