# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding the Prework Experience*

Submitted by: **Myah Webb**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **9.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.

* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.

* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding

* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- I wanted to update the visual design of the website to make it more aesthetically pleasing to the eye by including margin styling to the content and adding a footer. I also included a button in the header to navigate to the "Our Games" section quickly.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- First off, I realized that I needed to do a refresher of my front-end 
 developer tech stack, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through the use of doing practice projects from YouTube videos.

- I would say that challenge 3 was the hardest section for me due to realizing that I needed to take a deeper dive into how to best utilize template literals and combine familiar concepts together to make a dynamic list based on a JSON string literal of data.

- Each challenge utilizes familiar concepts, though it highlights useful ways of going about displaying JSON data on a webpage in various ways. For me, destructors were a newer concept, but I I remeber using spreads during my internship project.

- During challenge 5, I found myself getting stuck on how to properly add the ternary logic within a template literal, but, in retrospect, it turned out to be a simple mistake.

- Overall, the challenges made me appreciate the versatility of JavaScript, and the background information in each challenge helped to jump-start me finishing the task. 
    - There were times I would come across the first step and feel at a loss about how to go about completing it. Through simply taking a step back and researching what I did know, I discovered the questions I should have been asking myself to find the solution.
